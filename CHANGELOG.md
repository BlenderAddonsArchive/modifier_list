# Changelog

## 1.1 - 21.3.2019

Only Blender 2.8 is supported from now on. Also, the name is changed from Modifier Popup Panel to Modifier List since this addon now also has a tab in  the sidebar. Because of that, when you install this new version, you need to remove the old version and add your favourite modifiers again.

By the way, the popup is now vertically a bit more compact. A bit too compact, I think, but that's unavoidable with the tabs.

### New Features and Changes

- This addon now has a tab in the sidebar (which can be disabled from addon preferences)
- Popup now has tabs
- Added a tab for vertex groups to the popup and a panel for them to the sidebar

## 1.0.1 - 28-2-2019

The following changes only apply to the Blender 2.8 version.

- Changed hotkey to alt + space because that's not in use by default in 2.8.
- Disabled editing it from preferences for now because of a bug in 2.8 which causes problems with that.
